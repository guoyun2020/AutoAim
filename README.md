# AutoAim
An automatic CS:GO aim and shot program, which is based on PaddleX-GPU. 
Warning: Never use it to cheat in PVP game!!!

1.My solution:
- Identification: Faster-RCNN
- Aim & shot: pyautogui

2.Visulization example:

3.Attention:
-The performance is varied depending on your GPU capability. 
-My PC's performance in game_test.mp4 is kind of slow owing to my inferior MVIDIA MX150.
